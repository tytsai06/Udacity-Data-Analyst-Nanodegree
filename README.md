# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree

This is the projects I did for **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree**.
The main purpose is to sharpen the skills such as SQL and Python and to discover the insights from data.

## Project Overview

There will be 5 projects (3 is done). In each project, I will explain the data and (specific) tools used as well as the insights discovered.


### Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends

The project is the introduction of data analysis. In the project, since I was interested whether latitude would make difference in temperature across the cities, I set the topic to be as follows: 

- Topic: _"Are cities at similar latitudes have a similar temperature?"_
- Data: the historical temperature data of 4 cities (London, Brussels, Victoria, Qiqihar)
- Tool: SQL, Excel 


### Project 2 - Investigate medical appointments in Brazil

The project goes through the overall process of data analysis, including data extraction, data processing and data visualization. It aims to know the reason and the features that affect the appointment.

- Topic: _"How many patients made appointments but no show? What are the possible factors and their distributions?"_
- Data: **No show appointment** in **Kaggle**: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments
- Tool: Python


### Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Results

The project put more emphasis on the statistical parts.  The main purpose is to understand the results of an A/B test implemented by an e-commerce website. The company developed a new web page in order to increase the number of users convert.

- Topic: help company decide if they should launch this new page, keep the old page, or run the experiment longer to make decision
- Data: the web page data (provided by **Udacity**)
